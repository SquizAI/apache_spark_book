## Introduction to Stream Processing

### What is Stream Processing?
Stream processing involves continuously analyzing and acting on data as it arrives, typically in real-time or near real-time. Unlike batch processing, which processes large, static datasets, stream processing handles unbounded sequences of data items.

### Challenges in Real-time Data Processing
*   **High Velocity and Volume:** Data can arrive very quickly and in large amounts.
*   **Low Latency Requirements:** Decisions often need to be made within milliseconds or seconds.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system must be resilient to failures and recover quickly without data loss.
*   **State Management:** Many streaming applications require maintaining state over time (e.g., user sessions, aggregations).

### Introducing Spark Streaming (Legacy DStream API)
Spark Streaming is an extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. It was the original streaming library in Spark, based on the concept of Discretized Streams (DStreams).

## Spark Streaming Architecture

### Micro-Batching Model
Spark Streaming ingests data from various sources and divides it into a sequence of small batches. These batches are then processed by the Spark engine to generate a corresponding sequence of batches representing the results.

### Discretized Streams (DStreams)
A DStream is a continuous sequence of RDDs representing a stream of data. Each RDD in a DStream contains data from a certain interval. Any operation applied on a DStream translates to operations on the underlying RDDs.

### Role of Receivers and Executors
*   **Receivers:** Long-running tasks launched on Spark executors that continuously receive data from streaming sources and store it in Spark's memory for processing.
*   **Executors:** Standard Spark executors run the receiver tasks and also process the micro-batches of data.

### Batch Interval
The batch interval is a user-defined duration (e.g., 1 second, 500 milliseconds) at which Spark Streaming groups the incoming data into batches.

## Setting Up Spark Streaming: `StreamingContext`

The main entry point for all Spark Streaming functionality is the `StreamingContext`.

### Creating a `StreamingContext`
```scala
// Scala
import org.apache.spark._
import org.apache.spark.streaming._

val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("MyStreamingApp").setMaster("local[2]") // local[n], n > 1 for receivers
val ssc = new StreamingContext(conf, Seconds(1)) // Batch interval of 1 second
```
```python
# Python
from pyspark import SparkConf
from pyspark.streaming import StreamingContext

conf = SparkConf().setAppName("MyStreamingApp").setMaster("local[2]")
ssc = StreamingContext(conf, 1)  # Batch interval of 1 second
```
Note: `local[n]` where `n` should be greater than the number of receivers to run, as receivers themselves are tasks.

### Starting and Stopping the Streaming Computation
```scala
ssc.start()             // Start the computation
ssc.awaitTermination()  // Wait for the computation to terminate (manually or due to an error)
// ssc.stop(stopSparkContext = true, stopGracefully = true) // Optional: Stop gracefully
```
```python
ssc.start()
ssc.awaitTermination()
# ssc.stop(stopSparkContext=True, stopGracefully=True)
```

## Creating DStreams (Input Sources)

DStreams can be created from various input sources.

### Basic Sources
*   **File Streams:** `ssc.textFileStream(directory)` monitors a Hadoop-compatible file system directory for new files written into it.
*   **TCP Sockets:** `ssc.socketTextStream(hostname, port)` creates a DStream from text data received over a TCP socket connection.

### Advanced Sources
These often require adding external dependencies (e.g., `spark-streaming-kafka-0-10_2.12`).
*   **Apache Kafka:** `KafkaUtils.createDirectStream(...)` or `KafkaUtils.createStream(...)`.
*   **Apache Flume:** `FlumeUtils.createStream(...)` or `FlumeUtils.createPollingStream(...)`.
*   **Amazon Kinesis:** `KinesisUtils.createStream(...)`.

### RDD Queues (For testing)
`ssc.queueStream(rddQueue)` can be used to create a DStream from a queue of RDDs, useful for testing.

## Transformations on DStreams

Similar to RDDs, DStreams support many transformations.

### Stateless Transformations
These transformations process each micro-batch independently without depending on previous batches.
*   `map(func)`, `flatMap(func)`, `filter(func)`: Similar to RDD transformations.
*   `reduceByKey(func)`: Applied to DStreams of key-value pairs.
*   `transform(rddToRddFunc)`: Allows applying arbitrary RDD-to-RDD functions on each RDD within the DStream.
    ```scala
    // Scala Example: Convert text to uppercase
    // val lines: DStream[String] = ...
    // val upperLines = lines.map(_.toUpperCase())
    ```
    ```python
    # Python Example: Filter lines containing "error"
    # lines_dstream: DStream[str] = ...
    # error_lines = lines_dstream.filter(lambda line: "error" in line)
    ```

### Stateful Transformations
These transformations maintain state across micro-batches.
*   **`updateStateByKey(updateFunc)`:** Allows maintaining an arbitrary state for each key in a DStream of key-value pairs. The `updateFunc` takes the new values for a key in the current batch and the previous state for that key, and returns the updated state.
    *   Requires checkpointing to be enabled.
    ```scala
    // Scala Example: Word count over time
    // val words: DStream[(String, Int)] = ...
    // def updateFunction(newValues: Seq[Int], runningCount: Option[Int]): Option[Int] = {
    //   val currentCount = newValues.sum
    //   val previousCount = runningCount.getOrElse(0)
    //   Some(currentCount + previousCount)
    // }
    // val runningWordCounts = words.updateStateByKey[Int](updateFunction _)
    ```
*   **`mapWithState(spec)`:** A more advanced version of `updateStateByKey` offering more control, including timeouts for idle states.

## Windowed Operations on DStreams

Windowed operations compute results over a sliding window of time.
*   **Window Length:** The duration of the window (e.g., 30 seconds).
*   **Sliding Interval:** The interval at which the window operation is performed (e.g., 10 seconds). Must be a multiple of the batch interval.

*   `window(windowLength, slideInterval)`: Returns a new DStream which is computed based on windowed batches.
*   `countByWindow(windowLength, slideInterval)`
*   `reduceByWindow(func, windowLength, slideInterval)`
*   `reduceByKeyAndWindow(reduceFunc, windowLength, slideInterval)`

```scala
// Scala Example: Count items in the last 30 seconds, updated every 10 seconds
// val ipAddressDStream: DStream[String] = ...
// val ipCountLast30Sec = ipAddressDStream.countByWindow(Seconds(30), Seconds(10))
```
If the `slideInterval` is the same as the `windowLength`, it's a **tumbling window**. If `slideInterval` is smaller, it's a **sliding window**.

## Output Operations on DStreams

Output operations trigger the actual processing of the data.
*   `print()`: Prints the first few elements of each RDD in the DStream to the console (for debugging).
*   `saveAsTextFiles(prefix, [suffix])`: Saves the DStream's content as text files.
*   `foreachRDD(func)`: The most generic output operator. It applies a function to each RDD generated in the DStream. This is commonly used to write data to external systems (databases, file systems, dashboards).
    ```scala
    // Scala Example: Saving each RDD to a database
    // wordCountsDStream.foreachRDD { rdd =>
    //   rdd.foreachPartition { partitionOfRecords =>
    //     // ConnectionPool.getConnection().send(partitionOfRecords)
    //     // Make sure to handle connections efficiently (e.g., per-partition)
    //   }
    // }
    ```

## Using DataFrames and SQL with DStreams

You can easily use DataFrames and Spark SQL operations on streaming data.
The `foreachRDD` method is commonly used in conjunction with the `transform` operation if you want to apply RDD-to-DataFrame conversions within the stream processing pipeline.

```scala
// Scala
// Assuming access to a SparkSession 'spark'
// val lines: DStream[String] = ...
// lines.foreachRDD { rdd =>
//   if (!rdd.isEmpty()) {
//     val df = spark.read.json(rdd) // Or create DataFrame from RDD of case classes
//     df.createOrReplaceTempView("stream_data")
//     val resultDF = spark.sql("SELECT user, COUNT(*) as count FROM stream_data GROUP BY user")
//     resultDF.show()
//   }
// }
```

## Checkpointing for Fault Tolerance

Checkpointing saves the generated RDDs and metadata to a fault-tolerant storage system (like HDFS or S3). This allows Spark Streaming to recover from failures.
*   **Metadata Checkpointing:** Saves the definition of the streaming computation (DStream graph, configuration). Allows recovery of the driver.
*   **Data Checkpointing:** Saves the generated RDDs. Essential for stateful transformations (`updateStateByKey`, `reduceByKeyAndWindow`) as the state itself depends on previous RDDs.

```scala
ssc.checkpoint("hdfs:///checkpoints/my_app") // Set checkpoint directory
```
Checkpointing is crucial for stateful operations to recover lost state.

## Performance Considerations (Brief Overview)
*   **Batch Interval:** A key parameter. Smaller intervals lead to lower latency but higher overhead.
*   **Parallelism:** Ensure enough parallelism in transformations (e.g., by specifying `numPartitions` in `reduceByKeyAndWindow`).
*   **Serialization:** Use efficient serializers like Kryo.
*   **Memory Management:** Tune Spark's memory settings (`spark.memory.fraction`, `spark.memory.storageFraction`).

## Introduction to Structured Streaming

While DStreams were foundational, Spark introduced **Structured Streaming** as a higher-level, more robust, and easier-to-use API for stream processing, built on the Spark SQL engine.
*   **Unbounded Table Model:** Treats a live data stream as a continuously growing table.
*   **Unified API:** Uses the same DataFrame/Dataset API for batch and streaming computations.
*   **End-to-End Exactly-Once Semantics:** Provides stronger fault-tolerance guarantees.
*   **Event Time Processing:** Rich support for handling data based on the time events actually occurred, rather than when Spark processes them.
*   **Windowing on Event Time:** Sophisticated windowing capabilities.

**For new streaming applications, Structured Streaming is generally recommended over the DStream-based Spark Streaming.** We will cover Structured Streaming in more detail in a later chapter.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter explored Spark Streaming, Spark's original library for processing real-time data streams using the DStream API. We learned about its micro-batching architecture, how to create DStreams from various sources, and apply stateless and stateful transformations, including powerful windowed operations. We also covered outputting processed data, integrating with Spark SQL, and the importance of checkpointing for fault tolerance. While DStreams provided a solid foundation, it's important to be aware of Structured Streaming, which offers a more modern and unified approach to stream processing in Spark and is generally preferred for new development.
