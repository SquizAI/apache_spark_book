## Revisiting Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)

### What is an RDD?
An RDD is the fundamental data abstraction in Apache Spark. It represents an immutable, partitioned collection of elements that can be operated on in parallel. RDDs are the workhorse of Spark's low-level API, providing fine-grained control over data processing.

### Core Properties of RDDs

*   **Immutability:** Once an RDD is created, it cannot be changed. Any transformation applied to an RDD results in a new RDD. This property simplifies fault tolerance and makes computations more predictable.
*   **Distributed Nature:** Data within an RDD is typically split into multiple partitions, and these partitions can be distributed across different nodes (executors) in a Spark cluster. This allows for parallel processing.
*   **Resilience and Fault Tolerance (Lineage):** RDDs achieve fault tolerance through a concept called *lineage* (or dependency graph). Each RDD maintains a pointer to its parent RDD(s) and the transformation that was applied to create it. If a partition of an RDD is lost (e.g., due to an executor failure), Spark can use this lineage to automatically recompute the lost partition from the original data source.
*   **Lazy Evaluation:** Transformations on RDDs are *lazy*. This means Spark doesn't execute a transformation immediately when it's defined. Instead, it builds up a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of operations. The computations are only triggered when an *action* is called. This allows Spark to optimize the overall execution plan.
*   **Partitioning:** Each RDD is divided into one or more partitions. Partitions are the basic units of parallelism in Spark. The number of partitions can influence performance and can be controlled by the user or determined by Spark based on the data source or transformations.

## Creating RDDs

RDDs can be created in three main ways:

### 1. Parallelizing Existing Collections
You can create an RDD by parallelizing an existing Scala collection (like a `List` or `Seq`) or a Python list in your driver program using `spark.sparkContext.parallelize()`.

**Scala Example:**
```scala
val data = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(data)
```

**Python Example:**
```python
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(data)
```
This method is useful for prototyping, testing, or when your data already resides in memory in the driver.

### 2. Referencing External Datasets
Spark can create RDDs from any storage source supported by Hadoop, including your local file system, HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, Amazon S3, etc. The most common method is `spark.sparkContext.textFile(path)` which reads a text file and returns an RDD of strings (each string being a line in the file).

**Scala Example:**
```scala
val linesRDD = spark.sparkContext.textFile("hdfs:///user/data/input.txt")
// Or from a local file:
// val linesRDD = spark.sparkContext.textFile("file:///path/to/local/input.txt")
```

**Python Example:**
```python
lines_rdd = spark.sparkContext.textFile("s3a://my-bucket/input.txt")
# Or from a local file (ensure path is accessible by all workers if not in local mode):
# lines_rdd = spark.sparkContext.textFile("file:///path/to/local/input.txt")
```
Spark also supports other file formats like SequenceFiles (`sequenceFile[K, V](path)`) and can integrate with custom Hadoop InputFormats.

### 3. Transforming Existing RDDs
New RDDs are created by applying transformations to existing RDDs. This is the most common way RDDs are derived in a Spark application and will be covered in the next section.

## RDD Operations: Transformations

Transformations are operations on RDDs that return a new RDD. They are lazily evaluated.

### Narrow Transformations (No Shuffle)
Narrow transformations are those where each partition of the parent RDD is used by at most one partition of the child RDD. They don't require data to be shuffled across the cluster.

*   **`map(func)`:** Returns a new RDD by applying a function to each element of the source RDD.
    ```scala
    val numbersRdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(List(1, 2, 3))
    val squaredRdd = numbersRdd.map(x => x * x) // Result: RDD(1, 4, 9)
    ```
    ```python
    numbers_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1, 2, 3])
    squared_rdd = numbers_rdd.map(lambda x: x * x) # Result: RDD[1, 4, 9]
    ```
*   **`flatMap(func)`:** Similar to `map`, but each input item can be mapped to 0 or more output items (func should return a sequence or iterator).
    ```scala
    val linesRdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(List("hello world", "spark is fun"))
    val wordsRdd = linesRdd.flatMap(line => line.split(" ")) // RDD("hello", "world", "spark", "is", "fun")
    ```
    ```python
    lines_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(["hello world", "spark is fun"])
    words_rdd = lines_rdd.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" ")) # RDD['hello', 'world', 'spark', 'is', 'fun']
    ```
*   **`filter(func)`:** Returns a new RDD containing only the elements that satisfy a predicate (a function returning a boolean).
    ```scala
    val numbersRdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
    val evenRdd = numbersRdd.filter(x => x % 2 == 0) // RDD(2, 4)
    ```
    ```python
    numbers_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    even_rdd = numbers_rdd.filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0) # RDD[2, 4]
    ```
*   **`mapPartitions(func)`:** Similar to `map`, but operates on each partition of the RDD. The function `func` takes an iterator for a partition and returns an iterator. More efficient than `map` if there's setup cost per partition.
*   **`mapPartitionsWithIndex(func)`:** Similar to `mapPartitions`, but also provides the index of the partition to the function `func`.
*   **`union(otherDataset)`:** Returns a new RDD containing all elements from the source RDD and the argument RDD.
*   **`intersection(otherDataset)`:** Returns a new RDD containing only elements present in both RDDs.
*   **`distinct([numPartitions]))`:** Returns a new RDD with unique elements.
*   **`sample(withReplacement, fraction, seed)`:** Returns a new RDD containing a random sample of elements.

### Wide Transformations (Shuffle Involved)
Wide transformations (or shuffle transformations) are those where multiple child RDD partitions may depend on a single parent RDD partition, or a child RDD partition may depend on multiple parent RDD partitions. This typically requires data to be redistributed across the cluster (a shuffle).

*   **`groupByKey([numPartitions])`:** Groups values with the same key. For an RDD of `(K, V)` pairs, returns an RDD of `(K, Iterable<V>)`.
    ```scala
    val pairs = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(List(("a", 1), ("b", 1), ("a", 2)))
    val grouped = pairs.groupByKey() // RDD(("a", Iterable(1, 2)), ("b", Iterable(1)))
    ```
    ```python
    pairs_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([("a", 1), ("b", 1), ("a", 2)])
    grouped_rdd = pairs_rdd.groupByKey() # RDD[('a', <iterable>), ('b', <iterable>)]
    ```
*   **`reduceByKey(func, [numPartitions])`:** For an RDD of `(K, V)` pairs, aggregates values for each key using an associative and commutative reduce function.
    ```scala
    val pairs = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(List(("a", 1), ("b", 3), ("a", 2)))
    val reduced = pairs.reduceByKey(_ + _) // RDD(("a", 3), ("b", 3))
    ```
    ```python
    pairs_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([("a", 1), ("b", 3), ("a", 2)])
    reduced_rdd = pairs_rdd.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y) # RDD[('a', 3), ('b', 3)]
    ```
*   **`aggregateByKey(zeroValue)(seqOp, combOp, [numPartitions])`:** More general than `reduceByKey`. Aggregates values for each key using a sequential operation within partitions and a combining operation between partitions.
*   **`sortByKey([ascending], [numPartitions])`:** Sorts a key-value RDD by key.
*   **`join(otherDataset, [numPartitions])`:** For RDDs of `(K, V)` and `(K, W)` pairs, returns an RDD of `(K, (V, W))` for keys present in both.
*   **`cogroup(otherDataset, [numPartitions])`:** For RDDs of `(K, V)` and `(K, W)`, returns `(K, (Iterable<V>, Iterable<W>))`.
*   **`cartesian(otherDataset)`:** Computes the Cartesian product with another RDD.
*   **`repartition(numPartitions)` and `coalesce(numPartitions, shuffle=False)`:** Change the number of partitions. `repartition` always shuffles, while `coalesce` can avoid shuffle if decreasing partitions.

## RDD Operations: Actions

Actions are operations that trigger the computation (execution of the DAG) and return a result to the driver program or write data to an external storage system.

*   **`collect()`:** Returns all elements of the RDD as an array/list at the driver. **Use with caution on large RDDs**, as it can cause the driver to run out of memory.
    ```scala
    val dataRdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(List(1, 2, 3))
    val result = dataRdd.collect() // result: Array(1, 2, 3)
    ```
    ```python
    data_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1, 2, 3])
    result = data_rdd.collect() # result: [1, 2, 3]
    ```
*   **`count()`:** Returns the number of elements in the RDD.
*   **`first()`:** Returns the first element of the RDD (similar to `take(1)`).
*   **`take(n)`:** Returns an array/list with the first `n` elements of the RDD.
*   **`takeSample(withReplacement, num, [seed])`:** Returns an array/list with a random sample of `num` elements.
*   **`takeOrdered(n, [ordering])`:** Returns the first `n` elements of the RDD using either their natural order or a custom comparator.
*   **`reduce(func)`:** Aggregates the elements of the RDD using a specified associative and commutative function.
    ```scala
    val numbersRdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(List(1, 2, 3, 4))
    val sum = numbersRdd.reduce(_ + _) // sum: 10
    ```
    ```python
    numbers_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4])
    sum_val = numbers_rdd.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y) # sum_val: 10
    ```
*   **`fold(zeroValue)(func)`:** Similar to `reduce`, but takes a `zeroValue` for the initial call on each partition and for the final aggregation.
*   **`aggregate(zeroValue)(seqOp, combOp)`:** Similar to `aggregateByKey` but for a non-Pair RDD. Aggregates elements using a sequence operator within partitions and a combine operator between partitions.
*   **`foreach(func)`:** Executes a function `func` for each element of the RDD. This is usually done for side effects like printing or writing to an external system. The function runs on the executors.
*   **`saveAsTextFile(path)`:** Saves the RDD as a set of text files in a directory.
*   **`countByKey()`:** (For Pair RDDs) Counts the number of elements for each key.
*   **`countByValue()`:** Counts the occurrences of each unique element.

## Working with Key-Value RDDs (Pair RDDs)

Many Spark operations work on RDDs containing key-value pairs, known as Pair RDDs. These are RDDs where each element is a tuple (e.g., `(Key, Value)`).

*   **Creating Pair RDDs:** Often created using a `map` transformation, e.g., `wordsRdd.map(word => (word, 1))`.
*   **Transformations on Pair RDDs:** Operations like `reduceByKey`, `groupByKey`, `sortByKey`, `join`, `cogroup`, `mapValues` (applies a function to the value of each pair without changing the key), `flatMapValues`.
*   **Actions on Pair RDDs:** `countByKey`, `collectAsMap` (collects the result as a Map to the driver).
*   **Partitioning Pair RDDs:** The `partitionBy(partitioner)` transformation allows you to control how key-value RDDs are partitioned (e.g., using `HashPartitioner` or `RangePartitioner`). This can be crucial for optimizing shuffles in subsequent operations like `join` if the RDDs are partitioned the same way.

## RDD Persistence (Caching)

### Why Persist RDDs?
Spark's RDDs are recomputed each time an action is called on them (due to lineage). If an RDD is used multiple times in an application (e.g., in iterative algorithms or interactive analysis), recomputing it can be inefficient. Persisting (or caching) an RDD allows Spark to store it in memory (or on disk) after it's computed for the first time, so subsequent accesses are much faster.

### Using `persist()` and `cache()`
*   **`rdd.cache()`:** This is a shorthand for `rdd.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY)`.
*   **`rdd.persist(storageLevel)`:** Allows you to specify a storage level.

### Storage Levels
Spark provides different storage levels to balance memory usage, CPU cost, and I/O:

*   **`MEMORY_ONLY`:** Store RDD as deserialized Java objects in the JVM. If the RDD does not fit in memory, some partitions will not be cached and will be recomputed on the fly each time they're needed. (Default for `cache()`)
*   **`MEMORY_ONLY_SER`:** Store RDD as serialized Java objects (one byte array per partition). More space-efficient than deserialized objects, especially with fast serializers, but more CPU-intensive to read.
*   **`MEMORY_AND_DISK`:** Store RDD as deserialized Java objects. If the RDD does not fit in memory, store the partitions that don't fit on disk, and read them from there when needed.
*   **`MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER`:** Similar to `MEMORY_AND_DISK`, but store serialized objects in memory and on disk.
*   **`DISK_ONLY`:** Store the RDD partitions only on disk.
*   **Replicated versions (e.g., `MEMORY_ONLY_2`, `DISK_ONLY_2`):** Store each partition on two cluster nodes for fault tolerance (if one copy is lost, Spark can use the other without re-computation).

### Choosing a Storage Level
Consider factors like available memory, CPU overhead of deserialization, and the cost of re-computation. `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` is often a good default if memory is a concern and objects are large. If RDDs are expensive to compute and used frequently, `MEMORY_AND_DISK` can be a good choice.

### `unpersist()`
Call `rdd.unpersist()` to manually remove an RDD from the cache.

**Scala Example:**
```scala
val lines = spark.sparkContext.textFile("input.txt")
val words = lines.flatMap(_.split(" "))
val wordPairs = words.map((_, 1))
val wordCounts = wordPairs.reduceByKey(_ + _)
wordCounts.cache() // or wordCounts.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER)

println(s"Count: ${wordCounts.count()}") // First action, wordCounts is computed and cached
wordCounts.take(5).foreach(println) // Uses the cached wordCounts RDD

wordCounts.unpersist()
```

## Shared Variables

Normally, when a function passed to a Spark operation (like `map` or `reduce`) is executed on a remote cluster node, it works on separate copies of all the variables used in the function. These variables are copied to each machine, and no updates to the variables on the remote machine are propagated back to the driver program. Spark provides two types of shared variables for two common scenarios: broadcast variables and accumulators.

### Broadcast Variables
Broadcast variables allow the programmer to keep a read-only variable cached on each machine rather than shipping a copy of it with tasks. They can be used, for example, to give every node a copy of a large input dataset efficiently.

*   **Purpose:** Useful when tasks across multiple stages need access to the same large piece of data (e.g., a lookup table, a machine learning model).
*   **Creating:** `val broadcastVar = spark.sparkContext.broadcast(Array(1, 2, 3))`
*   **Using:** Access the value using `broadcastVar.value` within tasks.

**Scala Example:**
```scala
val lookupTable = Map("a" -> 10, "b" -> 20, "c" -> 30)
val broadcastLookup = spark.sparkContext.broadcast(lookupTable)

val data = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(List("a", "b", "a", "c"))
val mappedData = data.map(key => (key, broadcastLookup.value.getOrElse(key, 0)))
mappedData.collect().foreach(println) // Output: (a,10), (b,20), (a,10), (c,30)
```

### Accumulators
Accumulators are variables that are only "added" to through an associative and commutative operation and can therefore be efficiently supported in parallel. They can be used to implement counters (as in MapReduce) or sums.

*   **Purpose:** To aggregate values from worker tasks back to the driver. Common use cases include counting events, summing up values, or debugging.
*   **Built-in:** Spark natively supports numeric accumulators (`LongAccumulator`, `DoubleAccumulator`).
    ```scala
    val accum = spark.sparkContext.longAccumulator("My Accumulator")
    spark.sparkContext.parallelize(Array(1, 2, 3, 4)).foreach(x => accum.add(x))
    println(accum.value) // Output: 10
    ```
*   **Custom Accumulators:** You can create custom accumulators by subclassing `AccumulatorV2`.
*   **Caveats:** For transformations (lazy evaluation), Spark guarantees that each task's update to an accumulator will be applied only once if tasks are re-executed due to failures. However, if a stage is re-executed, updates might be applied multiple times. Updates within actions are generally safe. It's more reliable to read accumulator values only in the driver after an action.

**Python Example (Counter):**
```python
accum = spark.sparkContext.accumulator(0)
data_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
data_rdd.foreach(lambda x: accum.add(x))
print(accum.value) # Output: 15
```

## Chapter Summary

This chapter provided a deep dive into Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), the core abstraction of Apache Spark. We covered their defining characteristics like immutability, fault tolerance via lineage, and partitioning. We explored how to create RDDs from collections and external sources, and mastered a wide range of RDD transformations (narrow and wide) and actions. Special attention was given to key-value Pair RDDs and their powerful operations. Furthermore, we learned about RDD persistence for performance optimization and the use of shared variables – broadcast variables and accumulators – for efficient data distribution and aggregation. A solid understanding of RDDs is crucial for leveraging Spark's full potential, especially when fine-tuning performance or working with lower-level APIs. In the next chapter, we will move to higher-level APIs: Spark SQL, DataFrames, and Datasets.
